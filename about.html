                          I am curently a student at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/" target="_blank">Moringa School</a> undertaking a programming course
                          which will make me a full-stack developer on completion.

                          I always ever knew that I am a creator. I embrace my creations and therefore I always find myself creating something that I can be proud of. After the completion of my undergraduate in Environmental Planning and Management,
                          with the passion I have for technology, I found myself in spaces where technology was embraced. I could enjoy simple html codes which really looking nice. This sparked my curiosity to want to write such codes.
                           There I joined <a href="https://tunapanda.org/" target="_blank">Tunapanda Institute</a>
                          from where I wrote my first <em>Hello World</em> code and I was happy. From then, my passion for technology grew and I could see clearly what I could offer using Technology. 
                          I wanted to be a programmer and at the time I applied to be trained as a full-stack developer at Moringa School.
                          At the end pf the program, I ma looking foward to being a full-stack developer who can built complex scalable web applications and programs to solve varied problems.
